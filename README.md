# Subdomain Unique Lines


## Overview

Subdomain Unique Lines is a simple Bash script that removes duplicate lines from a file containing subdomains. It utilizes `awk` to process the file and outputs a new file without duplicate lines.


### Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the `sul.sh` script and make it executable.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qK21/subdomain-unique-lines/main/sul.sh
chmod +x sul.sh
```

### Usage Example

```bash
./sul.sh input.txt output.txt
```
Replace input.txt with your input file containing subdomains and output.txt with the desired name for the file without duplicates.
